        <p class="p1"> Ever since my dad showed me this series, I've been so entranced by the film's history and behind
            the
            scenes
            story. Everything from the origin of the story, to the family that created the film, and all the challenges
            the
            production of the film was involved in, I'm just fascinated by. This iconic trilogy began as an adaptation
            of Mario
            Puzo's book published in 1969. It was directed by Francis
            Ford Coppola starring Al Pacino, and this website will be focusing on the first film of the trilogy The
            Godfather (1972).
